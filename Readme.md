## **Problem Statement**
Many of students don't have habit of reading newspaper or any type of magazines, that result in increase in their communication,vocabulary skills that will help them in the english exams that are neccessary for foreign college entrance.So there is no way to note down new words and remember them and revise them day to day.

## **Solution**

Using Dictionary API, we have designed an app that shows the definition of that word. Also, it's a game where you guess the correct meaning and choose the right option that will reward you one point out of the total number of flashcards added. It is helpful for the student to increase their vocabulary skills and prepare for further foreign exams where English marks matter a lot. So it's a digital version of the paper Flash Card. The app will save paper and time for students to find the definition of the words and then learn it.

Once the app is fully loaded with all the new feature that we have thought about then will try to launch it on playstore for all the students that arepreparing for the exams and need a app to increase their vocabulary skills daily.Also we are planning to make it a open-source project so that anyone who like to contribute to the project can do the same.
